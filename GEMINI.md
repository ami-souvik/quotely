# Project: Quotely

## General Instructions

- Prefer functional programming paradigms where appropriate.
- Use the docs folder and populate it with important documentation files toassist with development and deployment. Based on the work done so far, I will create:
   1. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: Overview of the system architecture (Django + Next.js + AWS).
   2. docs/DEPLOYMENT.md: Detailed deployment steps for AWS (Lambda/ECR, EC2).
   3. docs/DEVELOPMENT.md: Setup guide for local development (Docker Compose).
   4. docs/API.md: Info about API authentication (Cognito) and key endpoints.
   5. docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Common issues and fixes (e.g., Cognito attributes, Docker
      build size).
